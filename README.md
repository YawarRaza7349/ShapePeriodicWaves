# ShapePeriodicWaves
I saw [this](http://imgur.com/gallery/DWuA6Vn) one day, and decided to write a Processing program to generate this sort of graph for any arbitrary shape. How it works is that a programmer can define their shape using the `setLoc` and `lineTo` methods of `PeriodicShape`. Thus, the programmer can create any shape that is made up of line segments (they don't even need to be connected). The programmer also specifies a center to "scan" around. The program displays both horizontal and vertical graphs, based off both the x- and y-coordinates of the intersections with the shape. The provided code comes with a triangle as an example shape, so the program can be run without modification to show a demo simulation.
